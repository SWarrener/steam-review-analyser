# steam-review-analyser

Performs basic statistical analysis on steam reviews. If anyone fancies doing such a project in the future then feel free to use or adapt the code in this repository as you see fit. You will need a steam API key.

To get the data run the programs in the following order:
1. AppIDList.py
2. csvmaker.py
3. review-getter.py
4. review-timeseries.py
5. data-normaliser.py

Then you can run analysis.py with the functions you want uncommented and get some graphs.
